          The Top lane role is a role where you are alone in the lane, you are
          in front of the enemy top laner fighting for control of the map. Top
          lane champions usually consist of Tank Champions, Bruiser Champions
          and sometimes Even Support Champions.So if you like champions that
          take no damage or champions that are mixed damage and defense top lane
          is a role that you will like.Also if you like fighting solo early and
          destroying the enemy top lane is a good match for you as there is not
          much objectives around top lane at early stages in the game.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="second-part">
        <p>
          Like all roles in the game top lane has a lot more to do than just
          fight the enemy, top laners must also keep the minion farm up they
          should ward the area of the enemy jungler also get ready to help
          you're jungler for objectives later on. The primary goal of a top
          laner is to get the enemy tower and open his part of the map and take
          control of top side of the map. Whomever takes control of his side of
          the map he wins his role that goes for all lanes not just top lane. In
          top lane you use two to three summoner spells depending on the
          champion you pick. Those summoner spells are Teleport, Ignite and
          Flash. If you have teleport then the best ways to use it early is if
          you fight and are low hp you recall and get back to lane using
          teleport that way you don't miss minions,the other way is to look for
          teleport opportunity to help you're other teammates in need most
          common bot lane fights and objectives like dragon.A good way yo use
          teleport is if you're fighting a strong enemy top laner who does not
          have teleport you play very aggressive early by fighting and letting
          the wave push to you're tower that way you can recall and get back to
          laner with full health and not miss a minion.

      <h3 class="section-h3">Team Fight Tanks</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of different champions you can pick in top lane, but the most common champions you play
          when you're with a team you know are Tank champions.<br>
          Tank champions don't really go off the meta because they are all ways reliable front liners to tank the enemy
          carrys damage and protect you're damage dealers. I will give you some recommendations for Tank champions.<br>
      </div>

      <div class="sec-con">
          1. Ornn <img class="champ-icons" src="./foto/orn.png" alt="there should be a img here..."></img><br>.
          Ornn is a very reliable Tank he has a lot of crowd
           control which consist of a lot of knock ups and slows. Ornn also has 
          a shield on is W combine that with how big of a tank
           he becomes later on he is very hard to kill. Plus his abilities do 
          hp% damage so he has a lot of potential to kill in lane,but Ornn does need more practice to
          get good with his abilities as some of them are hard to hit.<br>
      </div>

      <div class="sec-con">
          2. Malphite <img class="champ-icons"  src="./foto/Malphite.png" alt="there should be a img here..."><br>. 
          Malphite like Ornn is really tanky he also has a shield that comes of his passive. Unlike Ornn his abilities
          are much more easy to land and need practically no skill except his ultimate that is a skill shot. 
          Malphite in lane is very good at sustain with his passive shield and poke with his abilities. Once you bring
           you're enemies hp down he is very good at chasing and killing them with his Q. A goood Malphite
            on a teamfight will use his ultimate to turn the fight in his allies favor.<br>
      </div>

      <div class="sec-con">
        3. Shen <img class="champ-icons"  src="./foto/Shen.png" alt="there should be a img here...">.<br>
        Shen really shines in early fights because of his ultimate where he channels a 
         teleports to a allie anywhere in the map and gives a big shield to protect them. This can turn the tide
         of the fight really fast in the favor of you're team in small teamfights like in bot lane 2v2 or mid lane.
         You can help you're team win early fights and become more feed in the game. Late game Shen provides stuns,
         slows and a lot of tankines, with his W that makes him and his team immune to auto attack damage in a 
         small area. <br>
         <br>
         Those were some of the strongest tanks right know but there is a lot more of them you can check them out in the
         game and see which ones you like.

          <h3  class="section-h3">Solo Carry Champions</h3>
          <p>
            Solo carry champions we usually call those bruisers with a lot of damage while still being tanky.
            The difference from tanky champions is that bruisers have less crowd control and are less tanky, but thats not
            a problem because they make up with the damage they deal. Solo carry champions are champions you play when you 
            don't play with a team you know and like to have matters more in you're hands. These kind of champions require
            a lot of skill to play  successfully and win. You win you're lane hard then you take you're lead around the map
            and take you're team forward. Some of the best solo carry champions for top are:<br>
        
        </div>
        <div class="sec-con">
          1. Fiora <img class="champ-icons"  src="./foto/Fiora.png" alt="there should be a img here...">. <br>
          Fiora is one of the strongest duelist champions with a lot of outplay potential. Few champions can get
          away from Fiora once she engages. She has a lot of damage with the potential to one shot squishy champions
          with a swift combo of abilities. Late game almost no one can beat Fiora in a 1v1 scenario. After she kills
          a enemy with her ultimate she leaves a mark on the ground that heals allies that stand on top of it. 
          She is one of the best split push champions as she has good escape and good 1v2 or 1v3 potential, with a W that
          used correctly can reflect a crowd control ability to the enemies. <br>
        </div>
        <div class="sec-con">          
         2. Jax <img class="champ-icons"  src="./foto/Jax.png" alt="there should be a img here...">. <br>
         Jax is a very strong champion with a lot of mobility with his low cd Q and a lot of basic attack 
         damage with his W and ultimate passive. He has a stun on his E that he channels while moving and while
         he channels he takes no damage from auto attack. He is very squishy early but he scales a lot late game
         becoming more tanky and a lot more damage with power to solo teamfights and splitpush. <br>
        </div>
        <div class="sec-con">                 
         3. Darius <img class="champ-icons"  src="./foto/Darius.png" alt="there should be a img here...">. <br>
         Darius is very strong early with a lot of damage and sustain. Few to none champions can kill him early
         if played correctly. Darius doesn't have much mobility but he makes up with a Q that 
         heals a W that slows and a E that pulls enemies close to him. His passive once stacked gives him almost
          unfair damage and his ultimate with a stacked passive does a huge amount of damage, if you kill someone
          with you're ultimate it resets and you can use it again. As a Darius you look to win you're lane hard
          get ahead early and destroy teamfights mid game. <br>
        </div>
        <div class="sec-con">
        4. Renekton <img class="champ-icons"  src="./foto/Renekton.png" alt="there should be a img here...">. <br>
        Renekton is similar in the way you win a game like Darius, getting ahead early and destroying teamfights
        midgame . Unlike Darius he has a mobility and also has 
        a Stun on his W. He also has a lot of sustain with his passive and Q. It is really hard to get away from a
        Renekton as he can dash 2 times with his E if he hits it once he can cast it again. His ultimate makes him
        bigger increasing his auto attack range and the range of his abilities plus he gains a aura around him 
        that damages enemies close to him, once Renekton 
        activates his ultimate he becomes a real monster on the rift.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are a lot of different solo carry champions these were just some of the best you can look at others
        and play what you most enjoy
