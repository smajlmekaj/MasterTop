        <h2>Early Levels Wave Management</h2>
        <p>
          Wave management is an important role for any lane. For top lane you
          need to be very carful with you're Wave because miss positioning it
          can lead to losing the lane. There are three important wave management
          styles first is freezing then comes slow pushing and fast pushing.
          Freezing is good early if you're with a champion that is a lane bully
          it can help make you're enemy lose minions gold and XP by freezing the
          wave in front of you're tower. Freezing is done when the enemy minion
          wave has 4 minions more then you're wave and last hitting the enemy
          minions by not letting them crash in you're tower. Freezing is also
          good when you're in a losing champion matchup that way you can be safe
          under you're tower while farming. Slow pushing in the early game is a
          good way to build a huge allie minion wave and crashing it in the
          enemy tower, its a good way to set up dives make pressure and baiting.
          Slow pushing is done by killing the caster minions in the wave and
          leaving the melee minions to last hit. Fast pushing is a good way to
          punish you're enemy when you win a trade and they recall or when you
          kill them. It will get the allie minions to die to the enemy tower and
          not let the enemy champion farm them. Fast pushing can be done by
          killing the minions as fast as possible with abilities and not just
          normal attacks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="ahead">
        <h2>When Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          When ahead in top lane its good to focus on getting objectives and
          roaming around the map. If you can get the tower thats the first thing
          you should be focused on by making slow pushes and crashing big waves
          in the tower. If not you should kill the minions as fast as possible
          and look for herald ganks mid or helping you're jungler.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="behind">
        <h2>When Behind</h2>
        <p>
          When behind you should focus on farming and staying alive best way to
          do that is to do that is by freezing the way in front of you're tower
          and farming. Freezing the wave also gives opportunities for ganks as
          the enemy laner must walk deep on the lane to get farm and not get
          behind, if you can get a kill or two with ganks that will make a huge
          difference for you. Also if you're behind you should build you're
          items with tank stats as that will be more beneficial for the team.

        <h3 class="h3-section2">Tank Team Fights</h3>
        <p class="section2-p">
          As a tank champion in team fights you are the front line of defence
          for you're team. You should be focused to not let any enemy champion
          break through you and attack the back line. Tank champions also have
          the best engages because the have a lot of crowd control abilities, so
          if you're team is close look for a pick best ones being the damage
          dealers of the enemy team. Use you're abilities to cancel the counter
          attack or engages of the enemy tanks or assassin's, then just stay in
          front so they cant attack the back line.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="fighters">
        <h3 class="h3-section2">Fighters Team Fights</h3>
        <p class="section2-p">
          Fighter champions have a lot of kill potential for the enemy squishy
          champions, if you can pick one when they are out of place that will be
          a great engage that you're team can follow on. As a fighter champion
          you should focus on getting past the tanks and killing the back line
          as fast as possible with you're high damage and after disengage and
          survive with you're medium tankines until you're abilities come back
          on. <br />
          A very effective strategy for some fighter champions is split pushing,
          you do that by getting far ahead in the lane phase and focusing on
          destroying the enemy towers and inhibitors. Split pushing means
          pushing alone and trying to either get the towers or make the enemy
          bring two or more champions to stop you that way you leave you're team
          in a advantageous situation of 4v3 team fights.
